# The Impact of Air Quality on Respiratory Health

## Overview
This project, conducted by Sri Kumar Dundigalla as part of the ISM6419 Fall 2023 course under Prof. Johannes Reichgelt, investigates the correlation between ambient particulate matter pollution levels and all-cause mortality rates across various countries. With a comprehensive analysis spanning densely populated nations to countries with clearer skies, this research uncovers the significant impact of air pollution on global health outcomes.

## Objective
To explore the link between air pollution and health outcomes, specifically:
- The relationship between air pollution and mortality rates on different continents.
- The disparity in the impact of air pollution in various regions.
- Age-specific vulnerability to air pollution.
- The influence of regional wealth on air quality.
- The prevalence of lung diseases in relation to air quality.

## Data Sources
Data was meticulously collected from reputable sources, including:
- WHO Air Quality Database
- HealthData.org
- Our World in Data (Indoor and Outdoor Air Pollution)
- World Health Organization (Life Expectancy)
- The World Bank (Population Data)
- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
- Science Magazine

## Visualizations
The project features several key visualizations, including:
1. Global Respiratory Infection Death Rates
2. Temporal Trends in Respiratory Deaths
3. Comparative Age-Specific Mortality
4. Gender Disparity in Respiratory Infection Fatalities
5. Air Pollution and Respiratory Deaths Correlation
6. Respiratory Infection Death Rates by Continent
7. Asthma Prevalence by WHO Region
8. Percentage COPD Prevalence by States in USA
9. Outdoor Pollution and Age-Specific Mortality

Two dashboards provide a comprehensive view of pollution's global health impact.

## Conclusions
- A significant correlation exists between high levels of particulate matter pollution and increased mortality rates.
- Chronic respiratory diseases like asthma and COPD are unevenly distributed across regions, influenced by environmental factors, healthcare access, and genetics.
- Further research is needed on the impact of air quality improvements, the economic costs of air pollution, and the effects of climate change on pollution levels and health outcomes.

## Additional Research Questions
The project also proposes additional research questions for future investigation.
